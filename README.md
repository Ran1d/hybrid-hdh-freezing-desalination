MSc thesis – Hybrid desalination (HDH + freezing + absorption) – GOR 7.91, SEC 22 kWh/m³
# Hybrid HDH + Freezing + Absorption Desalination System  
### MSc Thesis – Rand Ahmad Bushnaq – Jordan University of Science and Technology (2026)

**World-class validated performance (2020–2024 literature):**
- **Gained Output Ratio (GOR) = 7.91**  
- **Specific Electricity Consumption = 24.8 kWh/m³**  
- **Total freshwater production = 8.39 m³/day**  
- **Validation error < 3 %** against contemporary references (Liu 2023, Elrahman 2020, Beniwal 2023, etc.)

**Novel features**
- Full waste-heat-driven hybrid: HDH + freeze desalination + single-effect LiBr-water absorption chiller
- Full ice-melt + brine cold recovery loop (30 % energy saving vs literature)
- Complete Python/Tkinter GUI with live simulation
- NSGA-II multi-objective optimisation
- Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis
